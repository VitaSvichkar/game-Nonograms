      <h1>General Rules of Nonogram: </h1>

      <ul>
        <li>The numbers indicate groups of consecutive filled cells in that row or column. For example, a clue of "4 1"
          means there is a block of 4 consecutive filled cells followed by at least one empty cell and then a block of 1
          filled cell.
        </li>

        <li>
          Your task is to correctly color the cells to reveal a hidden picture, all while adhering to the number clues
          for each row and column.
        </li>

        <li>
          A cross (usually marked with the right mouse button) means that the cell must remain empty.
        </li>

        <li> The puzzle is solved when all the cells are correctly filled or marked, and the image appears.</li>
      </ul>
